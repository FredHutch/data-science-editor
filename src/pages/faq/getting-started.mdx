## Where can I get Jacdac devices?

Please visit the Jacdac [device catalog](/devices) to find what devices are available and where to purchase them.

## Can I use Jacdac without hardware?

Yes! Jacdac provides web-based simulators for most of its [services](/services),
and has been integrated with web-based programming environments like [MakeCode](/clients/makecode).

## What happens if I short-circuit the Jacdac pins?

We require that all Jacdac power supplies have current limiting built into them. This means that any short-circuits on the Jacdac bus are automatically detected and cause power delivery to be suspended. Within less than a second of the short-circuit being removed, power will automatically resume. This interruption of power will, of course, cause Jacdac devices that are powered from the bus to switch off for a short time; they will then reset when power resumes.

## How Jacdac handles packet loss and collisions?

Jacdac Single Wire Serial links are assumed to be lossy - that is applications need to deal with some packets being lost.
There are several mechanisms in the protocol that help with that (ACKs, idempotent commands, pipes, streaming registers)
and SDKs have various retry policies.
So any glitch on the line (think hot-plugging!) or collision is no big deal (unlike in say I2C where a glitch can lock the bus until power off).
Collisions can happen when two devices start transmitting (initial low pulse) at "the same time", that is within a few clock
cycles of each other; typical collision rate on a highly utilized bus is around 0.1%.
The 220Î© series resistors prevent the colliding devices from driving the bus too hard in opposite directions.
