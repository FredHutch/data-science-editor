# Jacdac Python

**Beta: the python layer is still in pre-release mode and beta quality.**

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into desktop **Python** projects,
including on Raspberry Pi.

-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-python)
-   [API Reference](https://jacdac-python.readthedocs.io/)

## PyPi Package

Add [jacdac-python](https://pypi.org/project/jacdac-python/) to your project using `pip` (or `pip3` on Windows)

```
python -m pip install --upgrade --user jacdac-python
```

## Connecting to hardware

The transport used to connect to the Jacdac device typically varies a lot depending on the platform and the usage scenario.

### JacHAT

A JacHAT is a Jacdac adapter for the Raspberry Pi that provides an SPI bridge to the Jacdac bus.

### USB/Serial

Connection to USB or serial device is not yet supported.

## Getting started

Let's learn about Jacdac by creating a couple small projects.

### Developer tools

The first step of a Jacdac project is to create a bus which will handle all the communication and
the management of the service client.
Since the bus communicates with hardware, configuring it may vary **a lot** whether you are on a Raspberry Pi or a desktop computer.

To provide a consistent experience, we recommend using the Jacdac developer tools.
The developer tools rely on the browser WebUSB/WebSerial/WebBluetooth to connect to the hardware devices and uses a local web socket server
to pipe the packets to the Python SDK. This also allows to debug your Python code in a virtual machine with no hardware access, like GitHub codespaces.

```
python -m jacdac.devtools
```

Once the devtools server is running, you should be able to navigate to the local web server and see a dashboard.

- open [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)

If you wish to access the dashboard from another computer,
use the ``--internet`` and the web server will bind to **all** network interface.

```
python -m jacdac.devtools --internet
```

### Blinky

Let's build a blinking LED light project, assuming you have a [LED](/services/led) module.

The first step is to start a Jacdac `Bus` instance. The bus instance will automatically try to connect to the devtools;
but there are many other configuration options (see also how to use configuration files).

```python
from jacdac import Bus

bus = Bus()
```

Next we create an LED service client (and assign it the `led` role).
The client will allow us to change the color on the LED module.

```python
from jacdac.led import LedClient

led = LedClient(bus, "led")
```

Finally, we create a loop with a couple `sleep` command to
toggle between blue and red.

```python
led.brightness = 0.5
# fade between colors
while True:
    # blue
    led.set_all(0xff0000)
    sleep(1)
    # off
    led.set_all(0x000000)
    sleep(1)
```

All together, we get:

```python
from jacdac import Bus
from jacdac.led import LedClient
from time import sleep

bus = Bus()
led = LedClient(bus, "led")
led.brightness = 0.5
# fade between colors
while True:
    # blue
    led.set_all(0x0000ff)
    sleep(1)
    # off
    led.set_all(0x000000)
    sleep(1)
```
