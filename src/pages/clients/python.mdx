# Jacdac Python

**The python library is still under heavy development**

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into **desktop python** projects.

-   [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-python)
-   [API Reference](https://jacdac-python.readthedocs.io/)

## PyPi Package

Add jacdac-python to your project using `pip` (or `pip3` on Windows)

```
pip install jacdac-python
```

## Getting started

Let's learn about Jacdac by creating a couple small projects.

## Developer tools

The first step of a Jacdac project is to create a bus which will handle all the communication and
the management of the service client.
Since the bus communicates with hardware, configuring it may vary **a lot** whether you are on a Raspberry Pi or a desktop computer.

To provide a consistent experience, we recommend using the Jacdac developer tools.

-   install Node.JS
-   install Jacdac command line tool (`jacdac-cli`)

```
npm install -g jacdac-cli
```

-   launch the devtools server (and keep it running)

```
jacdac devtools
```

Once the devtools server is running, you should be able to navigate to the local web server and see a dashboard.

> Pro tip: You can use `devtools` from a GitHub codespaces virtual machine :)

## Blinky

Let's start with a blinking LED light project, assuming you have a [LED](/services/led) module.

```python
from jacdac.devtools import create_dev_tools_bus

bus = create_dev_tools_bus()
```

Next we create an LED service client (and assign it the `led` role).
The client will allow us to change the color on the LED module.

```python
from jacdac.led import LedClient

led = LedClient(bus, "led")
```

Finally, we create a loop with a couple `sleep` command to
toggle between blue and red.

```python
speed = 64
brightness = 128
while True:
    # blue
    led.animate(0, 0, brightness, speed)
    sleep(1)
    # red
    led.animate(brightness, 0, 0, speed)
    sleep(1)
```

All together, we get:

```python
from jacdac.devtools import create_dev_tools_bus
from jacdac.led import LedClient
from time import sleep

bus = create_dev_tools_bus()
led = LedClient(bus, "led")

speed = 64
brightness = 128
while True:
    # blue
    led.animate(0, 0, brightness, speed)
    sleep(1)
    # off
    led.animate(0, 0, 0, speed)
    sleep(1)
```
