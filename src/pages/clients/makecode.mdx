# MakeCode Clients

The [pxt-jacdac](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac) extension contains MakeCode support many Jacdac services.

## Usage

-   Open [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/), [Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) or [Maker](https://maker.makecode.com/)
-   Open or create a new project.
-   Add the **Jacdac** extension.
-   You should see a **Modules** drawer in the toolbox, under **Advanced**.

### Adding blocks for services

-   In the simulators, start the Jacdac service you want to useful. For example, start a button.
-   Click on "Add Blocks" to add the blocks for this service in your project.
-   Open the **Modules** drawer in you will find the blocks for your service.

```blocks
modules.button1.onUp(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.SmallHeart)
})
modules.button1.onDown(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
```

### Programming with a physical device

In the micro:bit editor, you can connect your micro:bit V2 using WebUSB and the editor will automatically communicate with the physical device and services.
You can use a mix of simulators or physical services to work on your code.

### "One micro:bit to rule them all"

To avoid having the micro:bit simulator **and** the physical micro:bit running code at the same time, Jacdac automatically disable one of the two micro:bit when restarting the simulator or downloading code into the physical device.

* when a physical micro:bit restarts, the simulator micro:bit enters proxy mode.
* when the simulator micro:bit restarts, the physical micro:bit enters proxy mode. 
* in proxy mode, the physical micro:bit still transmits the Jacdac packets, so you can see physical services, but does not execute MakeCode code.

## Advanced: Servers

It is also possible to spin some server services using MakeCode.
This can be useful to test Jacdac until more modules are available.

## micro:bit V2 server

-   Open the micro:bit editor
-   From the home screen, import https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/devices/microbit
-   Download to a micro:bit V2

Once downloaded, the firmware will expose most of the micro:bit sensors as Jacdac services.

## Open Source

The sources of the MakeCode clients are in GitHub at https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac.
