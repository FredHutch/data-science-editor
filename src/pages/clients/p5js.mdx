# p5.jacdac, a p5.js library for Jacdac

**p5.jacdac** integrates Jacdac with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) to create creative coding with physical devices.

-   in the online p5.js editor, https://editor.p5js.org/, only WebSerial is supported at the moment. To use
    WebUSB or WebBluetooth, run p5js locally.

## Usage

Download the [p5.jacdac library](https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js) or use the online version (recommended) and add it to the head section of your HTML document.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js"></script>
```

or

```html
<script src="./p5.jacdac.js"></script>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/jacdac-ts/dist/p5.jacdac.js"></script>
    </head>
    ...
</html>
```

That's it! p5.jacdac will automatically show a "connect" button to connect to your
device and hide it when connected.

## Sensors

The state of all sensor readings connected to the bus can be access through the `jacdac.sensors` object.
The readings are grouped into a `number[]` per service type and keyed with the service camel name (`button`, `potentiometer`, ...).

To access the readings, start by extracting the [service](/services) data you want.

```javascript
// grabs an array with all potentiometer readings (number[]) connected to jacdac
const { potentiometer } = jacdac.sensors
```

Then map the reading to local variables. Depending on the number of connected sensors,
some value will be undefined so make sure to assign defaults.

```javascript
// destructure readings into r,g,b variables
// if sensors are missing, default to 0
const [r = 0, g = 0, b = 0] = potentiometer
```

Use those values any way you want!

```javascript
// rescale 0..1 to 0..255 and repaint background
background(r * 255, g * 255, b * 255)
```
