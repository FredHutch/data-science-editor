# Jacdac .NET

** Under development **

There are various ways to integrate Jacdac into **.NET** projects,
including on desktop, Raspberry Pi, TinyCLR devices.

-   [.NET for IoT](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/iot) on Raspberry Pi
-   [.NET 5+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) on desktop
-   [TinyCLR](https://www.ghielectronics.com/tinyclr/) on SITCore devices

## Connecting to hardware

The transport used to connect to the Jacdac device typically varies a lot dependending on the platform and the usage scenario.

### JacHAT

A JacHAT is a Jacdac adapter for the Raspberry Pi that provides an SPI bridge to the Jacdac bus.

-   [JM SPI bridge](/devices/microsoft/research/jmspibridgev37v37)

### USB/Serial

Connection to USB or serial device is not yet supported.

## Getting started

Let's learn about Jacdac by creating a couple small projects.

### Developer tools

The first step of a Jacdac project is to create a bus which will handle all the communication and
the management of the service client.
Since the bus communicates with hardware, configuring it may vary **a lot** whether you are on a Raspberry Pi or a desktop computer.

To provide a consistent experience, we recommend using the Jacdac developer tools.
The developer tools rely on the browser WebUSB/WebSerial/WebBluetooth to connect to the hardware devices and uses a local web socket server
to pipe the packets to the Python SDK. This also allows to debug your Python code in a virtual machine with no hardware access, like GitHub codespaces.

-   install Node.JS
-   install Jacdac command line tool (`jacdac-cli`)

```
(sudo) npm install -g jacdac-cli
```

-   launch the devtools server (and keep it running)

```
jacdac devtools
```

Once the devtools server is running, you should be able to navigate to the local web server and see a dashboard.

### Blinky

Let's build a blinking LED light project, assuming you have a [LED](/services/led) module.

The first step is to start a Jacdac `Bus` instance. The bus instance will automatically try to connect to the devtools;
but there are many other configuration options (see also how to use configuration files).

```cs
using Jacdac;

var bus = new JDBus(/* platform specific initialization */)
```

Next we create an LED service client (and assign it the `led` role).
The client will allow us to change the color on the LED module.

```cs
using Jacdac.Clients;

var led = new LedClient(bus, "led");
```

Finally, we create a loop with a couple `sleep` command to
toggle between blue and red.

```cs
var speed = 64;
var brightness = 128;
while(true) {
    // blue
    led.Animate(0, 0, brightness, speed);
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
    // red
    led.Animate(brightness, 0, 0, speed);
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
}
```

All together, we get:

```cs
using System.Threading;
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Clients;

static class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var bus = new JDBus(/* platform specific initialization */);
        var led = new LedClient(bus, "led");

        var speed = 64;
        var brightness = 128;
        while(true) {
            // blue
            led.Animate(0, 0, brightness, speed);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            // red
            led.Animate(brightness, 0, 0, speed);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
```

## .NET micro framework limitations

Jacdac.NET is designed to run on the .NET micro framework (TinyCLR, ...)
and up, so it does not have all the greatest lateset features of the .NET 5+ runtime.
