# React package

This package provides a [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to interact with the bus within a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
It is built on top of the [JavaScript package](/clients/javascript).

* [GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/react-jacdac)
* [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/react-jacdac/) for a full list of hooks.

## Installation

Add the [react-jacdac npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jacdac) module
to your project

```
npm install --save react-jacdac
```

or

```
yarn add react-jacdac
```

## Context setup

To use the hooks in this library, you must wrap your top-level component with the `JacdacProvider` which installs the `JacdacContext` in the React tree.

```tsx
import { JacdacProvider } from "react-jacdac"

// wrap your top-level layout tsx with JacdacProvider
const App = () => <JacdacProvider>...</JacdacProvider>
```

Once your provider is ready, you'll be able to use Jacdac anywhere within your React application.

### Hot-reload

If you are using hot-reload in your developmenet cycle, you will want to create a separate file that instantiates the bus
to avoid closing and opening connections on each reload.

```javascript
//---------------
// bus.ts
import { createWebBus } from "jacdac-ts"

export const bus = createWebBus()

//---------------
// layout.ts
import { JacdacProvider } from "react-jacdac"
import { bus } from "./bus"

const App = () => <JacdacProvider bus={bus}>...</JacdacProvider>
```

## Hooks

### useBus

The `useBus` hook ensures that the context is setup and returns the Jacdac bus.

```tsx
const Connected = () => {
    const bus = useBus()
    ...
}
```

### useDevices

The `useDevices` hooks gets a snapshot of the devices connected to the bus. It provides a number of filtering options.

```tsx
import { useDevices } from "react-jacdac"

const DeviceCount = () => {
    // all devices, minus articifial devices created to run jacdac
    const devices = useDevices({ ignoreInfrastructure: true })
    return <span>{devices.length}</span>
}
```

### useServices

The `useServices` hooks gets a snapshot of the services accross devices connected to the bus. It provides a number of filtering options.

```tsx
import { SRV_BUTTON } from "jacdac-ts"
import { useServices } from "react-jacdac"

const ButtonCount = () => {
    const buttons = useServices({ serviceClass: SRV_BUTTON })
    return <span>{buttons.length}</span>
}
```

### useRegister

The `useRegister` retrevies the register JDOM node from a service. This hook is typically used with `useRegisterValue` hooks
documented afterwards below.

```tsx
import { SRV_POTENTIOMETER, JDService, PotentiometerReg } from "jacdac-ts"
import { useRegister } from "react-jacdac"

const Position = (props: { slider: JDService }) => {
    const { slider } = props
    const positionRegister = useRegister(slider, PotentiometerReg.Position)
    ...
}
```

### useRegisterValue

The `useRegisterValue` decodes the latest register value and returns it into an unpacked value array.
If data is missing, the array is empty.

```tsx
import { SRV_POTENTIOMETER, JDService, PotentiometerReg } from "jacdac-ts"
import { useRegister } from "react-jacdac"

const Position = (props: { slider: JDService }) => {
    const { slider } = props
    const positionRegister = useRegister(slider, PotentiometerReg.Position)
    const [position] = useRegisterValue(positionRegister)
    return <span>{position}</span>
}
```

### useChange

The `useChange` hook retreives a mutable value from the JDOM tree and triggers a render when it mutates.

```tsx
const Connected = () => {
    const bus = useBus()
    // read the connected state of the bus
    const connected = useChange(bus, _ => _.connected)
    return <span>connected: {connected}</span>
}
```

It's not uncommon that the `useChange` hook receives a undefined node as an argument.
To handle this in the query callback, using the **`?.` operator** which checks for nullness before calling a function.

```tsx
import { JDService } from "jacdac-ts"

const ServiceName = (props: { service: JDService }) => {
    const { service } = props
    // notice the ?. to handle case when _ is undefined
    const name = useChange(service, _ => _?.name)
    return <span>{name || "?"}</span>
}
```
