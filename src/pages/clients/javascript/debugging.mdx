# Debugging

## Dev tools

Jacdac provides various tools in this web site to diagnose issues with modules.
The dashboard also provides the ability to start virtual modules which tends to be very useful when debugging Jacdac programs.

When building web-based Jacdac programs, using our Javascript SDK (or P5\*js...), you can use the [devtools](/clients/javascript/devtools)
to side load your Jacdac-enabled web page with our developer tools.

For convinience, launch `https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/javascript/devtools#YOURURL` where YOURURL is your web page url.
