# MakeCode Servers

It is also possible to turn your micro:bit V2 into a sensor or actuator by running Jacdac servers on it.
This can be useful to test Jacdac until more modules are available.

**This approach is used extensively to retrofit existing accessories into Jacdac modules using
[Software Only Jacdac](/ddk/makecode/software-only-accessory/).**

## micro:bit V2 servers

-   Open the [micro:bit editor](https://makecode.microbit.org), click on `Import` button (right side)
-   Choose `Import URL' and enter https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/devices/microbit
-   Put Jacdac in server mode by calling ``jacdac.startServer()`` at the end of `main.ts`

```javascript
jacdac.startServer()
```

-   Start any of the predefined servers based on your needs. In general, it's best to enable small number of servers per micro:bit.

```javascript

servers.buttonA.start()
servers.buttonB.start()
```
