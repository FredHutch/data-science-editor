# MakeCode Client for Button Service

The main way to work with a button is through event handlers for the events
*down*, *up*, and *hold*. The (unbounced) *down* event is raised when the
button is pressed, while the (unbounced) *up* event is raised when the button is released.
The *hold* event is generated if the button is held for more than 1/2 second,
and every 1/2 second after that until the button is released.

There are three handlers (*onDown*, *onHold*, and *onHeld*) for each of
the three events, as shown in the small example below

## Events

```blocks
let holdCount = 0
modules.button1.onDown(() => {
    holdCount = 0
    basic.showString("D")
})
modules.button1.onHold(() => {
    holdCount++
    basic.showNumber(holdCount)
})
modules.button1.onUp(() => {
    basic.showString("U")
})
```

## Registers

The low-level state of the button is accesible via the the `pressure` register,
which ranges in value from where 0 is open and 0xffff is fully pressed.

```blocks
forever(() => {
    if (modules.button1.pressure() === 0xffff) 
        basic.showString("D")
    else if (modules.button1.pressure() === 0)
        basic.showString("U")
    else
        basic.showString("x")
})
```
