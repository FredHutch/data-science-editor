# Rotary Encoder Extension

The rotary encoder client reports the position of an incremental
rotary encoder in number of clicks from the initial position (0),
where clockwise motion increases the position and counter-clockwise
motion decreases the position. 
The `position` method returns the current position. 

As is the case with all sensors, an event handler is supplied for when
the sensor value (position) changes by a specified amount.

The program below uses the two rotary encoder APIs to print 
the current position whenever it changes by one click:

```blocks
modules.rotaryEncoder1.onPositionChangedBy(1, () => {
    basic.showNumber(modules.rotaryEncoder1.position())
})
```
