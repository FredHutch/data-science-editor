# Sound LED

Use the `plot bar graph` block from the Jacdac LED module to visualize the sound level around you.
It works similarly as the block for the micro:bit screen.

## Plot bar graph on Jacdac LED

Let's start by adding a Jacdac plot bar graph block for the LED module.

-   drag a `led 1 plot bar graph of [0]` block from the `modules` toolbox
-   if you cannot find this block, start a _led ring 8x_ simulator in Jacdac and click **ADD BLOCKS** button

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    modules.led1.plotBarGraph(0)
})
```

## Plot sound level

Drag a `input sound level` block into the `plot bar graph` block to visualize the sound level. The bar graph will
automatically adjust to the ambient sound level.

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    modules.led1.plotBarGraph(input.soundLevel())
})
```

## Test in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `led ring 8x` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one. Drag on the microphone simulator to see different lights.

## Download to your micro:bit V2

Connect your micro:bit V2, slot it into the Jacdaptor and connect a Jacdac slider.
Press the **Download** button to get your code running on the micro:bit.
