# Heart Beat

Start a button simulator and add the blocks below to your project. Jacdac should automatically "bind" your simulated button
to `button1` and respond to `up`/`down` events by showing icons on the screen.

![Simulated button show large and small heart when pressed](./simheartbeat.gif)

```blocks
modules.button1.onUp(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.SmallHeart)
})
modules.button1.onDown(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
})
```

## Test in the simulator

It's time to test your code using the Jacdac simulator. If you haven't started a `button` simulator yet,
click on **Start simulators** to get one.
Try pressing the simulator button show the hearts.
