## Mixing simulator and physical modules

You can use a mix of simulators or physical services to work on your code.

In this example, we remove the button simulator and connect a physical keyboard cap module which implements the button service.
Automatically, the Micro:bit simulator connects to the physical button and uses it in the code.

## "Only one brain"

To avoid having the micro:bit simulator **and** the physical micro:bit running code **at the same time**,
Jacdac automatically puts one of the two micro:bit in a **proxy mode** when restarting the simulator or downloading code into the physical device.
In proxy mode, the Jacdac messages are transmitted by the MakeCode code is not executed

-   in proxy mode, the micro:bit renders a proxy icon.

-   when a physical micro:bit restarts, the simulator micro:bit enters proxy mode.
-   when the simulator micro:bit restarts, the physical micro:bit enters proxy mode.
-   in proxy mode, the physical micro:bit still transmits the Jacdac packets, so you can see physical services, but does not execute MakeCode code.

## Multiple Roles

When running your code, Jacdac binds the modules detected on the bus with the **roles** defined in your program.
Each service comes with a default role which is typically what you start with. For example `button1` is the default role for buttons.

```blocks
modules.button1.onUp(function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.SmallHeart)
})
```

However, if you want to create a program with multiple buttons, you would need to define additional roles in your program.

-   Open the **Modules** drawer
-   Click **Settings** to open the roles editor
-   Add and remove roles and go back

Once reloaded, you should be able to select your roles in the block drop downs.
