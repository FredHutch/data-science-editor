## Mixing simulator and physical modules

You can use a mix of simulators or physical services to work on your code.

In this example, we remove the button simulator and connect a physical keyboard cap module which implements the button service.
Automatically, the Micro:bit simulator connects to the physical button and uses it in the code.

## "Only one brain"

To avoid having the micro:bit simulator **and** the physical micro:bit running code **at the same time**,
Jacdac automatically puts one of the two micro:bit in a **proxy mode** when restarting the simulator or downloading code into the physical device.
In proxy mode, the Jacdac messages are transmitted by the MakeCode code is not executed

- in proxy mode, the micro:bit renders a proxy icon.

-   when a physical micro:bit restarts, the simulator micro:bit enters proxy mode.
-   when the simulator micro:bit restarts, the physical micro:bit enters proxy mode.
-   in proxy mode, the physical micro:bit still transmits the Jacdac packets, so you can see physical services, but does not execute MakeCode code.
