# Humidity Extension

The humidity extension reports the relative humidity
in percentage of full water saturation (0.0 to 100.0).
The `humidity` method returns the current humidity.

As is the case with all sensors, an event handler is supplied for when
the sensor value (humidity) changes by a specified amount.

The program below use the two humidity APIs to print
the current humidity when it changes by 5 percent:

```blocks
modules.humidity1.onHumidityChangedBy(5, function() {
    basic.showNumber(modules.humidity1.humidity())
})
```
