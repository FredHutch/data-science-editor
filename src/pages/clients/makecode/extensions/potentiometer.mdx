# Potentiometer Extension

The potentiometer extension reports position as a floating
point value between 0 and 100.
The `position` method returns the current position of the potentiometer.

As is the case with all sensors, an event handler is supplied for when
the sensor value (position) changes by a specified amount.

The program below use the two potentiometer APIs to print
the current position whenever it changes by 5:

```blocks
modules.potentiometer1.onPositionChangedBy(5, function() {
    basic.showNumber(modules.potentiometer1.position())
})
```
