# Button

The button extension provides event handlers for the events
*down*, *up*, and *hold*, as well as methods for accessing the underlying
state of a button. 

## Events

The (unbounced) *down* event is raised when the
button is pressed, while the (unbounced) *up* event is raised when the button is released.
The *hold* event is generated if the button is held for more than 1/2 second,
and every 1/2 second after that until the button is released.

There are three handlers (*onDown*, *onUp*, and *onHold*) for each of
the three events, as shown in the small example below

```blocks
let holdCount = 0
modules.button1.onDown(() => {
    holdCount = 0
    basic.showString("D")
})
modules.button1.onHold(() => {
    holdCount++
    basic.showNumber(holdCount)
})
modules.button1.onUp(() => {
    basic.showString("U")
})
```

## Button state (pressed, pressure)

The `pressed` method returns a boolean value indicated whether or not the button is currently
pressed down, which is a function of the lower-level `pressure` value.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    if (modules.button1.pressed())
        basic.showString("D")
    else
        basic.showString("U")
})
```

The lower-level state of the button is accessible via the the `pressure` method,
which ranges in value from 0-100. Depending on the type of button, 
the pressed state will be reached with a certain threshold, in the example below 70%.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    if (modules.button1.pressure() >= 70)
        basic.showString("D")
    else if (modules.button1.pressure() === 0)
        basic.showString("U")
    else
        basic.showString("x")
})
```
