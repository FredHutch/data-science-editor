# Equivalent CO₂

The CO₂ extension reports the equivalent CO₂ (eCO₂) in parts per million (ppm),
where a typical minimum is 400 and the maximum is 8192.
The `eCO2` method returns the eCO₂ reading.

The following program outputs the eCO₂ reading whenever it changes by 1 ppm

```blocks
modules.eCO21.onECO2ChangedBy(1, function () {
    basic.showNumber(modules.eCO21.eCO2())
})
```
