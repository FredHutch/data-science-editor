# Barometer Extension

The barometer extension reports the pressure in hPa 
(the abbreviated name for a hectopascal pressure unit,
which is exactly equal to a millibar).
The `pressure` method returns the current barometric pressure.

As is the case with all sensors, an event handler is supplied for when
the sensor value (pressure) changes by a specified amount.

The program below use the two barometer APIs to print
the current pressure whenever it changes by 0.2 hPa


```blocks
modules.barometer1.onPressureChangedBy(0.2, function() {
    basic.showNumber(modules.barometer1.pressure())
})
```
