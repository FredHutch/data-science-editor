# Relay Extension

The relay extension exposes the state of the relay
via the method `closed`, which returns the value
true when the relay is closed and false otherwise.

The events 'on' and 'off', with associated event handlers
are fired when the relay transitions from closed to open,
and from open to closely, respectively

The following code shows the APIs available for the 
relay:


```blocks
modules.relay1.onOn(() => {
    // when relay transitions from closed to open
    basic.showString("On")
    control.assert(!modules.relay1.closed())
})

modules.relay1.onOff(() => {
    // when relay transitions from open to closed
    basic.showString("Off")
    control.assert(modules.relay1.closed())
})
```
