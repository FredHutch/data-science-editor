# Relay Extension

The relay extension exposes the state of the relay
via the method `closed`, which returns the value
true when the relay is closed and false otherwise.

The events 'on' and 'off', with associated event handlers
are fired when the relay transitions from closed to open,
and from open to closely, respectively

The following example uses the `setClosed` method to 
close the relay (on press of button A) and to open
the relay (on press of button B). Event handlers for
the relay are fired for the change in state. Finally,
on press of buttons A and B simultaneously, the 
state of the relay is queryed using the `closed`
method:

```blocks
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    modules.relay1.setClosed(true)
})

input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    modules.relay1.setClosed(false)
})

modules.relay1.onOn(() => {
    basic.showString("Closed")
})

modules.relay1.onOff(() => {
    basic.showString("Open")
})

input.onButtonPressed(Button.AB, function () {
    basic.showString(modules.relay1.closed() ? "Closed" : "Open")
})
```
