# Light Level Extension

The light level extension reports light level as a floating
point value between 0 and 100.
The `lightLevel` method returns the current position of the potentiometer.

As is the case with all sensors, an event handler is supplied for when
the sensor value (lightLevel) changes by a specified amount.

The program below use the two light level APIs to print
the current light level whenever it changes by 5:

```blocks
modules.lightLevel1.onLightLevelChangedBy(5, () => {
    basic.showNumber(modules.lightLevel1.lightLevel())
})
```
