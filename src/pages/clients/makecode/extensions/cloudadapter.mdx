# Cloud Adapter

Allows to upload data to an IoT cloud provider or receive commands from the cloud.

## Upload data

The upload number block allows to upload a label and up to 5 numbers (you can have more in TypeScript).
The data will be cached with a timestamp if the adapter is offline.

Note that the adapter does not filter or compress the data so one needs to make sure to not overflow the cloud service with data.

```blocks
forever(() => {
    modules.cloudAdapter1.uploadNumber("temp", input.temperature())
    pause(5000)
})
```
