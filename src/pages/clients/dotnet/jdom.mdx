# .NET JDOM

JDOM is an object model
that reflects the state of the Jacdac elements:

-   A **[bus](/clients/dotnet/jdom/bus/)** is made of connected devices.
-   A **[device](/clients/dotnet/jdom/device/)** may host **services**.
-   A **[service](/clients/dotnet/jdom/service/)** has **[registers](/clients/dotnet/jdom/register/)** and **[events](/clients/dotnet/jdom/event/)**, accepts **commands**,
    and may return **acks**.
-   A **[register](/clients/dotnet/jdom/register/)** is an addressed data location,
    , that may be get, set or streamed.
-   Virtual servers to simulate devices.

All the above elements are nodes in the [JDOM](/clients/dotnet/jdom/). All elements implement a event emitter and observable pattern to
easily data-bind them in a variety of UI frameworks.


```cs copy
using Jacdac;
using Jacdac.Transports.Spi;

var bus = new JDBus();
bus.DeviceConnected += (s,e) => {
    var device = e.Device;
    Console.WriteLine($"{device} connected");
    var services = device.GetServices();
    foreach(var service in services) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"  {service}");
        if (service.ServiceClass == Constants.ServiceClasses.Button) 
        {
            var up = service.GetEvent(Constants.ButtonEvent.Up);
            up.Changed += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"  {service} is up!")
        }
    }
};
```
