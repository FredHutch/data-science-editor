# JDDevice

A **device** is a [JDOM node](/clients/dotnet/jdom/)
that hosts [services](/clients/dotnet/jdom/service/). A device is hosted in a [bus](/clients/dotnet/jdom/bus/).

This object inherits methods and properties from [node](/clients/dotnet/jdom/node/).

```cs
using Jacdac;

var bus = new JDBus(...);
bus.Changed += (s,e) => {
    var devices = bus.GetDevices();
    foreach(var device in devices)
        Console.WriteLine(device);
};
```

## Methods

### ``GetServices``

Gets the list of [services](/clients/javascript/jdom/service/) hosted in the device.

```javascript
var services = device.GetServices();
foreach(var service in services) {
    Console.WriteLine(service);
}
```

### ``GetService``

Retreives the service by **service index** in the device. `null` if not found.

```javascript
var service = device.GetService(pkt.ServiceIndex)
```
