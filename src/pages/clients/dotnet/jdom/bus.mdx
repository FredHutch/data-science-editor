# JDBus

A **bus** is the top-level [JDOM node](/clients/dotnet/jdom/).
It processes the incoming and outcoming packets,
handles the connection to the underlying communiction transport
and maintains a set of active [devices](/clients/dotnet/jdom/device/) nodes.

- .NET Core: [Jacdac.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Jacdac.NET/)
- TinyCLR: Not on nuget yet.

```cs
using Jacdac;

var bus = new JDBus(...);
// dump the state of all known devices, services and registers
bus.Changed += (s,e) => Console.WriteLine(bus.Describe());
```

The JDom provides a low-level access to the Jacdac infrastrure.

## Recipes

### Listing devices

You can query the bus at receive a snapshot of the [devices](/clients/dotnet/jdom/device/).

```cs
var devices = bus.GetDevices()
foreach(var device in devices)
    Console.WriteLine(device)
```

## Events

All bus state mutation are advertised by events. You can listen or subscribe to those events.
At the JDom level, all event handlers are run within the same thread of the caller;
so it is important to avoid blocking during a handler or you might start missing packets.
