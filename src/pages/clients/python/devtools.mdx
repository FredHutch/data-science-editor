# Python Developer tools

The first step of a Jacdac Python project is to create a bus which will handle all the communication and
the management of the service client.

Since the bus communicates with hardware, configuring it may vary **a lot** whether you are on a Raspberry Pi or a desktop computer.

To provide a consistent experience, we recommend using the Jacdac developer tools.
The developer tools rely on the browser WebUSB/WebSerial/WebBluetooth to connect to the hardware devices and uses a local web socket server
to pipe the packets to the Python SDK. This also allows to debug your Python code in a virtual machine with no hardware access, like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

```bash copy
python -m jacdac.devtools
```

Once the devtools server is running, you should be able to navigate to the local web server and see a dashboard.

-   open [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)

If you wish to access the dashboard from another computer,
use the `--internet` and the web server will bind to **all** network interface.

```bash copy
python -m jacdac.devtools --internet
```
