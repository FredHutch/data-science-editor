# Jacdac-Python on Raspberry Pi

A JacHAT is a Jacdac adapter for the Raspberry Pi that provides an SPI bridge to the Jacdac bus.

<DeviceSpecificationList tags={["adapter", "pi"]} />

## Raspbian Configuration

JacHAT uses low level features like pin IO and SPI that need to be enabled in Raspbian.

-   open the **Raspberry Pi configuration** dialog under **Preferences**, select the **Interfaces** tab, enable the **SPI** interface
-   install the `python3-libioctl` package and the `spidev` and `jacdac-python` Python packages

```bash copy
sudo apt install --upgrade -y python3-libgpiod
pip install --upgrade spidev jacdac-python
```

-   your pi is ready!
