# Jacdac/micro:bit V2 Interoperability

## The benefits of using Jacdac with micro:bit

Jacdac brings two key features to all sensors and actuators that might be used with micro:bit, namely **simulators** and **digital twins**:

-   **simulators** allows users to easily test sensors and actuators, even if they don't have the hardware to-hand;
-   **digital twins** provide a live view of the physical sensor/actuator state directly in the micro:bit code editor; and
-   **standardized blocks** provided by Jacdac reduce confusion for users and reduce the overhead for creators of new sensors and actuators.

As of today, Jacdac runs on **micro:bit V2** exclusively.

## Three different approaches to supporting Jacdac

There are three main approaches to integrating Jacdac with accessories for the micro:bit V2:
1. **Software-only** support requires no changes to accessory hardwareâ€”so it can work with accessories already in the market; and is also the easiest to implement.
2. Adding the Jacdac connector and a minimal amount of interface circuitry to allow the accessory to act as a Jacdac **power consumer** that can communicate on and be powered from the Jacdac bus.
3. Adding the Jacdac connector and a little more circuitry that allows the accessory to be a **power provider** that can power other Jacdac devices. 

There is technically a fourth option, independent power, but for most scenarios this gives the least good user experience so we do not recommend it for micro:bit scenarios.

These options are depicted below:

## [Software only Jacdac](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/) for existing accessories

The accessory sensors and actuators are surfaced as Jacdac servers by wrapping the existing extension into a Jacdac compatibility layer.
**This solution adds no cost and will work for existing accessories.**

-   Pros
    -   **retrofit existing accessories**
    -   simulation
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
-   Cons
    -   extension required
    -   no Jacdac connector
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)

**[Get started with software only Jacdac](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/)**

## Low powered physical connector

 and uses pin **12**. Until now, this pin has largely been reserved for accessibility applications, so many existing accessories do not use it. We believe that Jacdac provides a route to more accessible peripherals that work with micro:bit, in addition to supporting many more scenarios.

Existing and future micro:bit accessories can be integrated with Jacdac in several different ways. Each approach offers different benefits and requires different levels of investment.


In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, 
with the Jacdac line connected to micro:bit pin 12 through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design/electrical#signalling) circuit
and a [low power supply](/ddk/design/electrical#overview-of-jacdac-power-sharing) circuit.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
    -   Powered connector means module will just work when connected
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   extension required
    -   additional cost for power regulator
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)

Note that if your accessory already has a power regulator, you might already have the required circuitery in place.
For reference about integrating Jacdac with an edge connector, see the [Jacdaptor board schematics](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/deprecated_form_factor/altium_deprecated/reference-designs/JacdacMicroBitShieldLP%2029-0.6).

## Onboard Jacdac server with microcontroller unit

In this scenario, the accessory contains a microcontroller unit (MCU) that implements the Jacdac server protocol.
In this case, you do not need to provide any extension as the user will be able to use the built-in Jacdac client libraries.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no extension required
    -   compatible with any Jacdac hardware, including Raspberry Pi
-   Cons
    -   additional cost for power regulator and MCU

The Jacdac team provides firmware for extreme low cast MCUs like the [PADAUK](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) to reduce the cost impact. Follow the [hardware design guidance](/ddk/design/) for this option.

## Unpowered physical connector

In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, 
with the `JD_DATA` line connected to micro:bit **pin 12** through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design/electrical#signalling) circuit. The power line is **not** connected.

On the software side, the same approach applies in Software-Only Jacdac.

However, this approach is not recommended as it will lead
to a confusing experience for users where modules won't be powered unless another power module
is on the Jacdac line.

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no modification to existing extension code
    -   same github repository for code
    -   Jacdac connector at minimal cost
-   Cons
    -   Confusing user experience
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   extension required
    -   micro:bit v2 only (Jacdac is not supported on v1)
