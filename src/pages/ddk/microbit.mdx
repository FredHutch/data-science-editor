# micro:bit Accessories

Jacdac can be integrated into existing and future micro:bit accessories with different level of investment.
Jacdac brings **simulators** and **digital twins** of sensors/actuators:

-   **simulators** allows the user to easily test sensor/actuator without having to use the hardware
-   **digital twins** provides a live view on the physical sensor/actuator state in the editor
-   **standardized blocks** provided by the Jacdac project, means you have to maintain less extensions for your hardware

As of today, Jacdac runs on **micro:bit V2** exclusively and uses pin **12**.

## Level 0: Existing accessories

The accessory sensors and actuators are surfaced as Jacdac servers by wrapping the existing extension into a Jacdac compatibility layer.
This solution adds no cost and will work for existing accessories.

### Pros

-   No hardware changes to existing accessories
-   No software changes to existing extension code
-   Support for simulators and digital twins
-   Support for standardized Jacdac blocks
-   No new GitHub repository needed, Jacdac extension code stored in a subfolder

### Cons

-   No hardware Jacdac connector
-   Existing blocs are hidden to avoid confusion. Jacdac service blocks may have less options.

### Integration steps

-   install the makecode command line tool

```
npm install -g makecode
```

-   [ ] add a `mkc.json` file next to the `pxt.json` file in your extension with the following content

```json
{
    "targetWebsite": "https://makecode.microbit.org/",
    "links": {
        "PACKAGE_NAME": "."
    }
}
```

where `PACKAGE_NAME` is the name of your extension in `pxt.json`.

-   create a `jacdac` subfolder, and move to that folder

```
mkdir jacdac
cd jacdac
```

-   [ ] run makecode init to configure the folder

```
makecode init microbit --jacdac
```

-   [ ] add references to the service client libraries you need. For example, to use a button, do

```
makecode add jacdac-button
```

-   [ ] add a function that launches servers for each sensor
-   [ ] wire up the function to start when running on hardware

```ts
namespace servers {
    function startServers() {
        if (!jacdac.isSimulator()) {
            // start servers only on hardware
            TODO
        }
        //
        if (jacdac.checkProxy()) {
            // custom proxy code
            jacdac.proxyFinalize()
        }
    }
    startServers()
}
```

If your hardware is already using pin 12, disable that feature in Jacdac

```ts
TODO
```

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulation
    -   digital twin
-   Cons
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   no Jacdac connector

## Level 1: Unpowered physical connector

In this scenario, you integrate one or more [Jacdac PCB edge connectors](/ddk/design#pcb-edge-connector) into your design, with the JD_DATA line connected to micro:bit pin 12 through the required [signal conditioning](/ddk/design#signalling) circuit.

-   [ ] Jacdac data line requirements TODO

On the software side, the same approach applies in Level 0.

-   Pros
    -   retrofit existing accessories
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   Jacdac connector at minimal cost
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   Unpowered connector means user has to add a power source on the Jacdac bus

## Level 2: Powered physical connector

In this scenario, the Jacdac connector is powered using the required regulation circuit documented at ...

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   Powered connector means module will just work when connected
-   Cons
    -   new hardware design needed
    -   micro:bit v2 only
    -   extension required
    -   additional cost for power regulator

Note that if your accessory already has a power regulator, you might already have the required circuitery in place.

## Level 3: Onboard Jacdac server with MCU

In this scenario, the accessory contains an MCU that implements the Jacdac server protocol.
In this case, you do not need to provide any extension as the user will be able to use the built-in Jacdac client libraries.

-   Pros
    -   simulator
    -   digital twin
    -   no extension required
    -   compatible with any Jacdac hardware, including Raspberry Pi
-   Cons
    -   MCU and power regulator circuitery add cost
