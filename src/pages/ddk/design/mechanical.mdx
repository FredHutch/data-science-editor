# Mechanical

## Module labelling

All modules should include silkscreen that allows a user to easily and uniquely identify the module, and its version number.

Modules may optionally include a QR code printed on the silkscreen. The QR code should point to **short url** that redirects to the product information. If your device is registered, you can redirect to [Jacdac device catalog](/devices/) device page.

To generate the QR Code for various CAD programs, you can use the [Jacdac Device QR Code generator](/tools/device-qr-code/).

## Module form factor

We recommend using the [EC30 module form factor](../ec30)
