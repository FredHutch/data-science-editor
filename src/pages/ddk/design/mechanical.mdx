## Module labelling

All modules should include silkscreen that allows a user to easily and uniquely identify the module, and its version number.

Modules may optionally include a QR code printed on the silkscreen. The QR code should point to **short url** that redirects to the product information. If your device is registered, you can redirect to [Jacdac device catalog](/devices/) device page.

To generate the QR Code for various CAD programs, you can use the [Jacdac Device QR Code generator](/tools/device-qr-code/).

## Standard module sizes and shapes

To make it easier for users to recognize Jacdac modules and for manufacturers to design Jacdac modules, we provide guidelines for a small number of standard form factors.

### Enclosure-compatible form factor

We are also working on the specifications for an 'enclosure-compatible' module form factor. This is designed to make it easier to build cheap enclosures for individual modules, or for groups of modules that constitute a working device. This will use four 3.2mm holes, will have straight board edges, and will require a component keepout/clearance band around the board outline. Full details will be published in due course.

### Cute form factor (deprecated)

Many of our prototype module reference designs use what we call a 'cute' form factor: they are small and have rounded board edges with mounting holes often protruding from the board edge.

To keep module size as small as possible, the cute form factor uses four 2.1mm holes on a 2.5mm pitch and often components are mounted on both sides of the PCB.
