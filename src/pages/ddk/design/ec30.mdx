# EC30 module form factor

To make it easier for users to recognize Jacdac modules, and for the modules to work with various electro-mechanical 
and mechanical accessories, we recommend the use of the [EC30---enclosure-compatible with 3.0mm mounting holes---module form factor](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/ec30).
In particular, the form factor was dseigned to make it easier to 
build cheap enclosures for individual modules, and to assemble groups of modules together to make a working device. 

The EC30 rectangular form factor has one or more *Jacdac edge connectors* on opposite sides of the PCB, four *mounting
holes*, and an *orientation notch* indicating the upper-left of the board (viewed from the top side of the the PCB). There is always at least
one Jacdac edge connector on the left.

In addition to the sections below, make sure to read up on the [electrical](../electrical) and [electro-mechanical](../electro-mechanical) design guidelines.

## Dimensions

The centers of mounting holes should be a multiple of 10mm apart in both x and y directions. The outline of the board extends 2.5mm from the holes to give a basic width of 25.0 by 25.0mm, but note that Jacdac edge connector(s) extend by a further 1.5mm. 

The smallest module is rectangular,  with holes spaced 10.0mm in x and 20.0mm in y, leading to 18.0 by 25.0mm overall. The smallest "square" EC30 module is 28.0mm (x-axis) by 25.0mm (y-axis). 
<!--The difference is due to the fact that the two edge connectors, oriented parallel to the x-axis, protrude 1.5mm from each side of the board.-->
The [EC30 shape generator](/tools/ec30) which generates EC30 shape profiles as SVG or DXF.

## Edge connectors

Each [Jacdac edge connector](../electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) is 6.6mm wide with clearance on each side to accommodate the cable connector and leave space for a "connector wall". If the Jacdac edge connector is not directly next to another, there should be exactly 2.7mm clearance; if more than one connector are adjacent they should be on a 10.0mm spacing, leaving 3.4mm between them, with exactly 2.7mm clearance on either side. 

Explore the possibilities with the [EC30 shape generator](/tools/ec30).

## Mounting hole names, electrical connections, and size

The mounting holes are named and connected as follows:
- **MH1** is at the *upper-left* corner of the board and is connected to *JD_DATA*, with the orientation notch immediately to its right
- **MH2** is at the *upper-right* corner of the board and is connected to *GND*
- **MH3** is at the *bottom-left* corner of the board and is connected to *JD_PWR*
- **MH4** is at the *bottom-right* corner of the board and is connected to *GND*

Mounting holes have a finished (plated) diameter of 3.1mm, with a 4.4mm diameter annular copper ring, and a solder resist keepout of 5.0mm diameter.

The mounting holes must be on 10mm pitch. This allows the modules to be mounted on a pre-drilled/perforated plate that has holes every 10mm in each direction.

## Outside layers routing keepout

Because the mounting holes and Jacac edge connectors are electrically connected, it is important to define keepouts for other routing.
In particular, each mounting hold has a 6.0mm diameter keepout, while each edge connector has a rectangular keepout (**STEVE: I am confused by the numbering of 4.3mm and 0.4mm and what they refer to**). No copper (except for the mounting hole net) can be in the mounting hole keepout areas to prevent shorts when mounting.

## Component placement keepout

The component placement keepout provides clearance for mounting bushes, connector wall, and other mounting features.

## Status LED locations

There should be one status LED on each side that has edge connectors, aligned with the edge connector.

## Silkscreen marking

The module name should be printed on the top surface of the PCB, to the right of the orientation notch.
