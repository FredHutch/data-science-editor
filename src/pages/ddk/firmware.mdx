# Firmware

## Getting started: module firmware

To date, we have firmware support for modules created using the following MCU families:

* **STM32**: [start here](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0/blob/main/README.md) to build firmware for the STM 32-bit series of MCUs
* **PADUAK (8-bit)**: [start here](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) to build firmware for the PADUAK 8-bit series of MCUs

See the bottom of this page if you have questions or need to file an issue.

## Github repository list

The Jacdac stack is layered, top-down, into [several Github repos](./github-repos).

## Flashing firmware onto hardware

We often use a simple [JacConnect programming header](./jac-connect) footprint for attaching a programmer to a Jacdac device. We have also documented how to use JacConnect with [ARM MCU tooling](./arm-tooling) and with [PADAUK MCU tooling](./padauk-tooling).
