# JacConnect Programming Header

For prototypes and small production quantities, we often use a 5 pin through-hole PCB header footprint for MCU programming and debugging. However, we don't solder a through-hole header into this footprint; instead we design the footprint so that header pins are a very snug fit, allowing a header to be gently pushed into the through-holes. The slightly springy nature of header pins means that the header stays in place for the duration of the programming or debugging, but can easily be removed. 

Using JacConnect for ARM MCUs is described in detail [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/dbg#target-end).

A similar approach can be used for PADAUK programming.
