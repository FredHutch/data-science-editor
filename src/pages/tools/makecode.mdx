# MakeCode

> We are currently working on an integration of Jacdac into the MakeCode code editors.
This process is still in progress and subject to change.

## Editors

Jacdac is available in the following editors:

* micro:bit beta https://makecode.microbit.org/beta, "Editor Extensions" experiment required
* MakeCode Arcade beta https://arcade.makecode.com/beta
* Maker https://maker.makecode.com/

To turn on Editor Extensions, click on **About**, then **Experiments** and **Editor Extensions**.

You can also code side-by-side using the multi editor https://makecode.com/multi?jacdac=1&beta=1

### Configuring your project

Create a **new project**, click on **Extensions** in the settings project. 
Search for ``jacdac`` and import **https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac**.

After the project reload, you should see the Jacdac frame under the regular simulator.
Compile your project again and download it to your device to make sure that the Jacdac stack is running on hardware as well 
(it is not builtin the default configuration of MakeCode).

### Simulators

To spin a device simulator, click on the ``+`` button near the a header called "Simulators". Select any of the simulator.
Once you have a simulator (or hardware device) running, a ``Add blocks`` button will appear. Clicking this button will
automatically import the blocs for those modules.

### Configuring modules

Open the **modules** toolbox, click on **Configure** which will open the Jacdac configuration
dialog.

Add the modules that you want to use in your project, each module has a role:
the **left button**, the **head sensor**, etc... The configuration dialog
prepare your project for those modules when you click on **Save**.

Once you are back in the editor, you will find new blocks to use those modules
and you will also find the roles of those modules in the drop down of each block.
