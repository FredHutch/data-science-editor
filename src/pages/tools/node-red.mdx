# Node-Red

You can leverage Jacdac from your [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) flow using https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-jacdac .

The nodes connect to a Jacdac bus via a USB and allow to listen for events or sensor readings.

## Requirements

This node uses [node-usb](https://github.com/tessel/node-usb) which has specific installation requirements. If your node-red process crashes with 
``LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``, your USB setup is not right.

## Install

Use Palette manager in node-red or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically ``~/.node-red``

    npm install node-red-contrib-jacdac

## Nodes

### jacdac-event

This node listens for [Jacdac events](/reference/protocol#events) and send them in the payload. 
You can browse the [services specification catalog](/services/) to discover which events are available.

### jacdac-read

This node listens for [Jacdac reading](/reference/protocol#registers) and send them in the payload. 
You can browse the [services specification catalog](/services/) (filter by ``Sensor``) to discover which reading registers are avilable are available.
