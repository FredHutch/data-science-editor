Jacdac is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware and software stack for microcontrollers and their peripherals such as sensors and actuators. Jacdac is primarily designed for “modular electronics” scenarios that support rapid prototyping, creative exploration, making and learning through physical computing. Jacdac is designed to be cheap, flexible and extensible.

-   a purpose-built 3-wire cable and edge connector that supports data communication and power delivery;
-   hot-plug device discovery;
-   standardized service specifications;
-   full stack support from 8-bit microcontoller firmware to web simulators and debuggers.
