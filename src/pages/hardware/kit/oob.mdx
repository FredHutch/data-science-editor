# Out of the Box

The micro:bit V2 from the Kit comes with a preloaded firmware that will use the Jacdac modules

## What to expect?

-  Plug the micro:bit into the Jacdaptor (make sure the front of the micro:bit and raise numbers on plastic edge connector of Jacdaptor are both visible) 

-  Supply power to the micro:bit

-  When a Jacdac module is added to or removed from the bus, the micro:bit displays the new count of devices on the bus

-  When a Jacdac button module is attached, the micro:bit will respond to the following events as follows

    -   Down: display a first icon on 5x5 LEDs and play a note (eight different icons and notes supported, for up to eight buttons)
    -   Hold: display a second icon
    -   Up: clear display

-   When a Jacdac sensor (slider, rotary encoder, thermometer) is attached and the sensor value changes appreciably,
    micro:bit will display a bar chart showing the magnitude of the reading register, or will display the value as a number

-   When a Jacdac actuator (LED pixel strip, single LED) is attached, the micro:bit will send a command to it based
    on which button of micro:bit is pressed (A, B, A+B)
