# Out of the Box

The micro:bit V2 from the Kit comes with a preloaded firmware that will use the Jacdac modules

## What to expect?

-   Connect one or more buttons

-   when a Jacdac module is added to or removed from the bus, the micro:bit displays the new count of devices on the bus

-   when a Jacdac button module is attached, the micro:bit will respond to the following events as follows
    -   Down: display a first icon on 5x5 LEDs and play a note (eight different icons and notes supported, for up to eight buttons)
    -   Hold: display a second icon
    -   Up: clear display

-   when a Jacdac sensor (slider, rotary encoder, thermometer) is attached and the sensor value changes appreciably,
    micro:bit will display a bar chart showing the magnitude of the reading register, or will display the value as a number

-   when a Jacdac actuator (servor, lights) is attached, the micro:bit will send a command to it based
    on which button of micro:bit is pressed (A, B, A+B)
