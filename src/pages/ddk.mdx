# Device Development Kit

The Jacdac Device Development Kit (DDK) is for 3rd party hardware designers, firmware developers and manufacturers who wish to create their own Jacdac [devices](/devices). A Jacdac device should:

-   have a [Jacdac edge connector](./design/electro-mechanical#pcb-edge-connector) for joining the device to the Jacdac bus
    using [Jacdac cables](./design/electro-mechanical#cable-connectors-and-assemblies)
-   implement the [Jacdac protocol](/reference/protocol/) to communicate over the bus via the connector
-   follow the [hardware design guidelines](./design/)
-   pass all the checks in the [device tester](/tools/device-tester/).

A common realization of a Jacdac device is a printed circuit board (PCB) that includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) connected to a specific set of components including sensors, actuators, network interfaces and/or power supplies. Jacdac devices may supply power to the bus and/or consume power from the bus.  Devices with a USB connection can support Jacdac over USB to communicate with a web browser.

## Key elements of the Jacdac DDK

The Jacdac DDK supports 3rd party device development via the following steps:

1. choosing on-board components and incorporating them in a [hardware design](./design);
2. identifying the [services](/services/) to represent the chosen components;
3. building [firmware](./firmware/) to establish [device identity](/reference#device-identification) and
   expose the device's services on the Jacdac bus;
4. validating the hardware using the [dashboard](/dashboard) and [device tester](/tools/device-tester)
5. [registering](/tools/device-registration) the device in the Jacdac [device catalog](/devices);

Our current Jacdac hardware and firmware designs target the [PADAUK 8-bit](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk) 
and [STM32x0 32-bit](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0) families of MCUs.
STM32x0 support includes a Jacdac bootloader service that allows MCU firmware to be updated over Jacdac.
We strongly encourage you to take advantage of our hardware and firmware reference implementations to simplify the above steps.

Hardware reference implementations of Jacdac modules, brains,
power supplies and Jacdaptors will be available in due course
at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk.

## micro:bit accessories

In the [Jacdac micro:bit integration guide](/ddk/microbit), we document various scenarios that will let you integrate Jacdac support in your accessories.
