A Jacdac brain is a programmable Jacdac device that runs [client code](/clients)
that makes use of [services](/services) that are available on the Jacdac bus,
usually provided by [modules](/start/modules). If a
brain has no [Jacdac edge connector](/start/edgeconnector), such as the micro:bit V2
on the upper left, it may need a [jacdaptor](/start/jacdaptor)
so that it can be connected to other Jacdac devices.
