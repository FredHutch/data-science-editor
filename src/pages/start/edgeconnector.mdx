## Jacdac edge connector and hubs

![Hub with 8 Jacdac edge connectors](./hubv10.jpg)

A Jacdac device usually has at least one edge connector, which is the 
three fingered part of the printed circuit board. The hub above is
a PCB with eight Jacdac edge connectors, all connected together in a
single three-wire bus. The edge connector is double sided, with connections on both side of the board,
so no matter which way you connect a Jacdac cable to an edge connector, a stable
electrical connection will be made.
