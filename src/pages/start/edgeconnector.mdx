## Edge connector and hubs

![Hub with 8 Jacdac edge connectors](./hubv10.jpg)

Most Jacdac devices have at least one edge connector, which is the 
tab with three metal fingers that integrated into the device's printed circuit board (PCB). 
The PCB above is a Jacdac hub with eight Jacdac edge connectors, all connected together into
a single three-wire bus by traces on the PCB. The hub has no electrical 
components; its purpose is only to add more connection points to a Jacdac bus. The hub has no means
of computation or communication, unlike [brains](/start/brains) and [modules](/start/modules),
which have microcontroller units with a CPU and hardware for input and output.

## Double-sided

The edge connector is double sided, with connections (three fingers) on each 
side of the board, so no matter which way you connect a Jacdac cable to 
an edge connector, a stable electrical connection will be made.

## No edge connector? No problem!

For existing devices that have no Jacdac edge connector, [jacdaptors](/start/jacdaptors) 
provide a means of bridging such devices onto the Jacdac bus.
