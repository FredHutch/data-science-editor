<ModuleImageList cols={3} />

Jacdac modules have one more hardware components, represented by one or more Jacdac [services](/services),
as well as one or more Jacdac [edge connectors](/start/edgeconnectors) to allow them to be connected
to other modules, [brains](/start/brains), or [jacdaptors](/start/jacdaptors). We see three
modules above, made by Kittenbot:
* the [Keycap Button](/devices/kittenbot/keycapbuttonv10/) is a **user input** module that hosts a button (and two edge connectors), represented in software by the [button](/services/button) service;
* the [Light Sensor](/devices/kittenbot/lightsensorv10/) is a **sensor** module that hosts a light sensor, represented by the [light level](/services/lightlevel) service
* the [RGB Ring](/devices/kittenbot/rgbringv10/): is a **user output** module hosting eight RGB LEDs, represented by the [LED](/service/led) service
