# Jacdac for MakeCode and the micro:bit

We are delighted to announce the public debut of Microsoft's [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) platform for plug-and-play creation and programming of physical computing systems.  Jacdac brings three exciting enhancements to MakeCode for the micro:bit: 

1. [modular accessories](#modular-accesories) with plug-and-play cables, shown above; 
2. [unified block coding](#unified-block-coding-for-accessories) for all accessories; 
3. [hardware simulators and device twins](#hardware-simulation-and-device-twins) for micro:bit accessories.  

A micro:bit V2 is required for deployment to hardware, as Jacdac needs more resources than available on the original micro:bit. Jacdac is [backward compatible with existing micro:bit accessories](#backward-compatible-with-existing-accessories). If that's enough for you, see our [call to action](#call-to-action) for MakeCode users and micro:bit accessory manufacturers. Otherwise, read on...

## Modular accesories

Jacdac is a hardware+software platform for the plug-and-play creation and programming of physical computing systems. A “brain”, in this case a micro:bit V2, executes the user’s program, while a set of modular accessories—or modules—provide additional capabilities, as shown below:

### Kittenbot's Jacdac Starter Kit A 

[Kittenbot](https:/www.kittenbot.cc) is making [Jacdac Starter Kit A with Jacdaptor for micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdacstarterkitawithjacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/), shown at the beginning of the blog and featured in the above video, available for purchase this summer in limited quantity. This first commercially-available kit features seven Jacdac modules, shown below. Kittenbot’s [Jacdaptor for the micro:bit V2](/devices/kittenbot/jacdaptorformicrobitv2v10/) has six Jacdac edge connectors that can be used to connect to Jacdac modules via the Jacdac cables.

## Unified block coding for accessories

Jacdac provides a large set of [services](/services) to describe the high-level functionality of hardware, both existing micro:bit accessories and new Jacdac modules.  The [button service](/services/button), which represents any push button, is one of the simplest Jacdac services.  Services enable programming against any hardware that supports the services, regardless of the manufacturer, with standardized MakeCode programming blocks. 

The video below shows blocks associated with the button and LED services, as well as a simple program that sets all the LEDs blue when a button down event is received, and turns the LEDs off when a button up event is received. Note that the program continues to function when the keycap button is replaced by a rotary button, as both modules support the button service.

## Hardware simulators and device twins

From the beginning, a web-based micro:bit simulator has been an essential part of the discovery process for the BBC micro:bit. For almost every service, Jacdac provides a simulator that integrates seamlessly into MakeCode, as well as a “device twin” that displays the status of a connected accessory.  The simulators let you program against Jacdac services without needing the hardware. The video below shows the use of the button simulator and device twin:

## Backward compatible with existing accessories

Jacdac has been designed so that it can be used with existing micro:bit accessories. For example, the [Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board for micro:bit](https://kitronik.co.uk/products/5674-kitronik-air-quality-board-for-bbc-micro-bit) can be described by six Jacdac services that cover the set of sensors/features of the board: [temperature](/services/temperature), [air pressure](/services/airpressure), [humidity](/services/humidity), [equivalent CO₂](/services/eco2), [real time clock](/services/realtimeclock) and [character screen](/services/characterscreen). We have created [Jacdac samples of extensions](/ddk/microbit/extension-samples/) for a variety of micro:bit accessories. [Click here](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta#pub:github:pelikhan/pxt-kitronik-air-quality/jacdac) to load the Jacdac extension for the Kitronik board into MakeCode.

As shown above, you’ll see a new category in the toolbar category (Modules) as well as a new pane (Simulators) under the micro:bit simulator (see two red arrows).  The Modules category contains the programming blocks for the six services associated with the Kitronik board. Using the “changed by” event handler for temperature (see bottom of the Modules category), we create a simple program, as shown in the screen snapshot below, that reacts to a change in temperature measured by the Kitronik board. We tell MakeCode to spin up a Jacdac simulator for the program, which allows us to set the temperature and see the program react, displaying the current temperature on the micro:bit screen.

Such a scenario simply wasn’t possible in MakeCode before Jacdac; as with the micro:bit simulator, you now can explore the hardware features of micro:bit accessories without needing the hardware itself!

## Call to action

### MakeCode users

To get started with Jacdac for MakeCode and the micro:bit, users have several options:
-	**Jacdac kits available**: see the [device catalog](/devices)!
-	**Software for existing accessories**. Try out a micro:bit accessory with a [Jacdac MakeCode extension](/ddk/microbit/extension-samples).
-	**Jacdac hardware simulators**. Try out [Jacdac Projects for MakeCode](/clients/makecode/projects) right away, using Jacdac simulators.
If you have questions, please see the [Jacdac FAQ](/faq) and/or visit the [MakeCode forum](https://forum.makecode.com/c/jacdac/59).

### Micro:bit accessory manufacturers

Jacdac provides manufactures of micro:bit accessories [several options](/ddk/microbit):
- **Software for existing accessories**. We have created a way to add Jacdac support to MakeCode extensions for existing accessories.  We have added Jacdac to several MakeCode extensions as [samples]((/ddk/microbit/extension-samples).  [Read more](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/) about software-only Jacdac.
- **Add a Jacdac edge connector to your designs**. It’s inexpensive to add the 3-wire [Jacdac edge connector](/ddk/microbit/#low-powered-physical-connector) to your accessory.	
- **Make your own Jacdac modules** using the Jacdac [Device Development Kit](/ddk).
